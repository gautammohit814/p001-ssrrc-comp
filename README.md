## What is NumPy?
* NumPy provides all the libraries to deal with the linear algebra.

*   NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python
* NumPy is the foundational package for mathematical computing
* Mathematical and logical operations on arrays
* `ndarray` is the core object in NumPy Basics ndarray
* Multidimensional array
* Homogeneous collection of values
* Fast and efficient
* Support for mathematical functions
* Primary container for data exchange between python algorithms

## What is Pandas?
Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy and matplot, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, data manipulation and visualization more convinient.

* Calculate statistics like What's the average, median, max, or min of each column? 
* Help to answer questions about the data like, column A correlate with column B? What does the distribution of data in column C look like?
* Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria
* Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database
